# Task: Build a Quiz App with score and timing, also visualize high scores

## Plan

set timer for the whole test.
set timer for each question.

Setup an array for the questions with fixed number of columns: each question must have a time to answer, the question number, the question, 4 possible answers, and last the position in which the answer is located.

HTML will only contain the title, the number of questions, the time needed to answer the current question. Additional to that will have a place holder for the possible answers in form of buttons, the color of the buttons will change with the hover option, it will change to another color if the click is pressed. If click is pressed, a submit buton will show active to make available the next question, once submit button is clicked, the page will go to the next question, refreshing the numbers.

HTML will have a UL and Li items to display possible answers.

Script will handle the LI items and all events.

# Execution of the Plan

## Overview

I was a little short on my planning, although I accomplished the task the road was very hard, what we see in class is sometimes too simple, when we do a task that combines several functions interacting is when it gets a little hairy.

Anyway, a great way to combined a lot of things learned during class and I have to add a lot that needs to be absorved with time and practice. This task has been my introduction again to the programming world since a left a long time a go. I found my programming neurons, they are still active, I know there is a lot more to come but excited to what is coming ahead.
